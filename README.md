This class will provide an introduction to Python for scientific computing,
with emphasis on statistical applications. In the pilot year, it will be run
as a workshop, and if successful, will be developed into a class for subsequent
years.

Target Audience
---
3rd or 4th year undergraduates, master's students, and 1st or 2nd year PhD
students. The students should have familiarity with programming, but not
necessarily using Python. The intention is to avoid excessive overlap with STA
141 and ECS 10 (basic programming via Python). Completion of one of these two
courses could be recommended or a pre-requisite.

Programming Environment
---
Python 3, since it's starting to be widely adopted. We can recommend a basic
text editor or the free PyCharm IDE (analogous to RStudio) for editing code.

Text
---
There are many excellent, free books available for basic programming in Python.
Most of the packages we'll cover are well-documented and provide examples.
_Python for Data Analysis_ by Wes McKinney might also be a useful reference.

Core Topics
---
+ Python Basics
    * syntax
    * tuples, lists, dicts (and possibly `collections`)
    * list comprehensions
    * iterators (and possibly generators)
    * string manipulation
    * documenting code
+ Numerical computing (`numpy` and `scipy`)
+ Plotting (`matplotlib` or `ggplot`)
+ Statistical methods (`sk-learn`)
+ Data manipulation (`pandas`)

Potential Topics
---
+ IPython
+ File I/O (`io` & `os.path`)
+ Command-line argument parsing (`argparse`)
+ Debugging (`pdb`)
+ Profiling (`timeit` and `cProfile`)
+ Test-driven development (`doctest`)
+ Object-oriented programming
+ Functional programming
