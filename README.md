# Python for Data Mining

[Python][] is a programming language designed to have clear, concise, and
expressive code.
An extremely popular general-purpose language, Python has been used for tasks
as diverse as web development, teaching, and systems administration.
This workshop provides an introduction to Python for data mining.

Messy data has an inconsistent or inconvenient format, and may have missing
values.
Noisy data has measurement error.
*Data mining extracts meaningful information from messy, noisy data.*
This is a start-to-finish process that includes gathering, cleaning,
visualizing, modeling, and reporting.

Programming and research best practices are a secondary focus of the workshop,
because [Python is a philosophy][zen] as well as a language.
Core concepts include: writing organized, well-documented code; being a
self-sufficient learner; using version control for code management and
collaboration; ensuring reproducibility of results; producing concise,
informative analyses and visualizations.

The workshop will meet for four weeks during the Winter 2015 quarter at the
University of California, Davis.

## Target Audience
The workshop is open to undergraduate and graduate students from all
departments.
We recommend that students have prior programming experience
and a basic understanding of statistical methods,
so they can follow along with the examples.
For instance, completion of STA 108 and STA 141 is sufficient
(but not required).

The statistics department's Spring 2015 machine learning course, STA 208, will
be language agnostic, so we encourage students who attend this workshop to
practice their Python skills again in Spring!

## Topics

### Core Python
The workshop will kick off with a quick introduction to the syntax of Python,
including operators, data types, control flow statements, function definition,
and string manipulation.
Slower, in-depth coverage will be given to uniquely Pythonic features such as
built-in data structures, list comprehensions, iterators, and docstrings.

Authoring packages and other advanced topics may also be discussed.

### Scientific Computing
Support for stable, high-performance vector operations is provided by the NumPy
package.
NumPy will be introduced early in the workshop and used often, because it's
the foundation for most other scientific computing packages.
The workshop will also cover SciPy, which extends NumPy with functions for
linear algebra, optimization, and elementary statistics.

Packages specialized for machine learning and statistical modelling will be
discussed during the final two weeks of the workshop.

### Data Manipulation
The pandas package provides tabular data structures and convenience functions
for manipulating them.
This includes a two-dimensional data frame similar to the one found in R.
Pandas will be covered extensively, because it makes it easy to

+ Read and write many formats (CSV, JSON, HDF, database)
+ Filter and restructure data
+ Handle missing values gracefully
+ Perform group-by operations (`apply` functions)

### Data Visualization

Many visualization packages are available for Python, but the workshop will
focus on Seaborn, which is a user-friendly abstraction of the venerable 
matplotlib package.

Other packages such as ggplot2, Vincent, Bokeh, and mpld3 may also be covered.

## Programming Environment
Python 3 has syntax changes and new features that break compatibility with
Python 2.
All of the major scientific computing packages have added support for Python 3
over the last few years, so it will be our focus.
We recommend the [Anaconda][] Python 3 distribution,
which bundles most packages we'll use into one download.
Any other packages needed can be installed using `pip` or `conda`.

Python code is supported by a vast array of editors.

+ [Spyder IDE][Spyder], included in Anaconda, 
  is a Python equivalent of RStudio, 
  designed with scientific computing in mind.
+ [PyCharm IDE][PyCharm] has very well-designed user interface. Chris uses
  PyCharm with the IdeaVim Vi plugin.
+ General-purpose text editors, such as [Vim][] and [Emacs][], are a great
  choice for ambitious students. They can be used with any language. 
  See [here][Text Editors] for more details. Clark and Nick both use Vim.
