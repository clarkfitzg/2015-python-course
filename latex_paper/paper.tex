\subsection*{Reproducible Research}

Makefiles make reproducible research easy! 

To build this as a pdf, navigate to the directory containing the make file and type {\tt make}. Note that you will need \LaTeX, R, and Python installed for this toy example. The makefile contains a list of dependencies and commands that acts as a recipe for building the final product, in this case a pdf. Later, if you change any step in the analysis you can issue the {\tt make} command again and the make program will run the appropriate commands to refresh the results.

Mathematical expressions are beautiful in \LaTeX. $x^2 + 5x + \pi$

This is the R graph made from the random numbers generated by Python, now embedded in a pdf.
